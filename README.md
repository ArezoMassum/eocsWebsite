# Charity Website - Development Overview

This document provides an overview of the technologies, architecture, and development practices utilized in the creation and maintenance of the Charity Website. Our platform is designed to support [charity's mission], enabling donations, volunteer sign-ups, and providing information about our projects and impact.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **HTML5**: Semantic HTML structure for content organization.
- **CSS3**: Styled using a combination of custom styles and a pastel-themed color scheme for a soft, welcoming aesthetic. Additionally, we use **Bootstrap** for responsive design components and layout utilities, enhancing the mobile responsiveness and user experience of our website.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements and enhancing user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Implemented using CSS Flexbox, Media Queries, and Bootstrap to ensure a seamless experience across all device sizes.

### Backend

- **Java**: Our backend is powered by Java, utilizing the Spring Boot framework for rapid development and easy deployment of web applications and services.
- **Database**: We use **MySQL** as our relational database management system (RDBMS) for storing user data, donations, and volunteer information. MySQL was chosen for its scalability, performance, and ease of integration with Java.

### Hosting/Deployment

- **[Hosting Service]**: The website is hosted on [Hosting Service], leveraging [any special features, e.g., CDN, SSL certificates for security].
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines are configured using [CI/CD tool], ensuring streamlined updates and maintenance.

## Development Practices

- **Version Control**: We use Git for version control, with a structured branching strategy for feature development, fixes, and releases.
- **Code Reviews**: Pull requests and code reviews are a standard practice, ensuring code quality and consistency.
- **Accessibility**: Adhering to WCAG guidelines to make our website accessible to as wide an audience as possible.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implementing best practices for fast loading times, including image optimization, lazy loading, and script deferment.
